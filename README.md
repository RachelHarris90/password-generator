## Features
### Window prompts & alerts
The inputs are entered by the user into window prompts.

Some validation exists on the length of the password, where the password must be a minimum of 8 and no more than 128 characters. If a number outside of this range is entered, the user will see an error in a window alert.

### Generated password in the browser
Once the required inputs have been entered, the user can click on the red "Generate Password" and will then see the random password in the box above.
